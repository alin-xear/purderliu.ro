            <p style="font-size: 22px">I’m a visual designer who left Brașov for the hustle and bustle of the
                Bucharest metropolis - I often get inspired by it but sometimes my thoughts frown at the place.</p>

            <p>
                The last 16 years in the creative industry taught me that as long as I treat every project with
                patience, loyalty and curiosity, there will be no steps back. I helped over 100 small and big
                businesses shape their creative voice through various print materials, online visuals and websites.
                Every project made me want to do more and better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some people have the words to bear. I play with colors, visual effects and images. I like to think
                that no proposal is crazy or impossible, just a challenge offered by a friend who trusted me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I consider myself a disciplined self-taught person, a rational dreamer, a perfectionist, an artistic
                person.
